I conducted a workshop where I introduced sorting algorithms to my colleagues at [andela](http://www.andela.com).

It was a great experience for me, because though I was familiar with sorting algorithms, I had to read more on them, so that I could teach it, and I think I did an awesome job, feedback from colleagues and the director of training at Andela - [Nadayar](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nadayar) confirmed that :)

Thanks to my mentor [Nick Larsen](http://careers.stackoverflow.com/nicklarsen) for his input

Below is my slide for the presentation, or you can [visit here to view it on slideshare](http://www.slideshare.net/AbimbolaIdowu/data-structures-and-algorithms-sorting-algorithms-49650167). Do not mind my that the slide is small, I did more of talking and writing on board since it's a workshop ;) .

I hope to complete the workshop soon, where I would be introducing fast algorithms and other types of medium share.
